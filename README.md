# SeriesTracker
Developed during [Movile](https://movile.com/)'s Movile Up Android course.

An app that provides series' information, seasons and episodes, and sends notifications when there are new episodes of favorited series (a Netflix-ish app without the *watching* part of it :sweat_smile:).

## What I learned
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Material Design](https://material.io/design/)
- Async data fetching using [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- MVP (model–view–presenter) architectural pattern
- Debugging with [Stetho](https://facebook.github.io/stetho/)
- [DBFlow](https://github.com/agrosner/DBFlow)
- & much more
